## Agent Usage Guide

This document outlines how to effectively use an AI agent for developing and maintaining the Whisper Transcriber application.

### High-Level Tasks

You can assign high-level tasks to the agent, such as:

> "Implement a new feature to email the transcript to the user."

> "Refactor the error handling in `app.py` to be more robust and provide clearer user feedback."

### Debugging

If you encounter a bug, you can ask the agent to investigate and fix it:

> "The application crashes when a user uploads a file larger than 100MB. Investigate the issue in `app.py` and apply a fix."

### Autonomous Operation

For more complex tasks, you can let the agent work autonomously:

> "The application is not working as intended. Please analyze the codebase, identify the problems, and fix them. The goal is to have a simple, working transcriber that takes an audio file, transcribes it with timestamps, and allows downloading the result as a text file."
